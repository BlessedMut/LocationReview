# Frameworks and technologies used:
## -Front-End
#### 1. Flask
    I used  because of its integrated support, built-in development server, quick debugger, and restful request routing allowing for unit testing in web development. Also It's light enough to quickly transition into a web framework with some extensions.
#### 2. HTML & CSS
## -Back-End
#### Python
## -Visualizations
#### Plotly & Dash
## -Database
#### Mongo DB
